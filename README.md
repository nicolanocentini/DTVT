===========================================================================

This repository contains the code implementation of the **Double-Threshold Validation Tool (DTVT)**, which is an automatic tool designed to validate pixel-based *Landslide Hazard Maps (LHMs)* and convert them into operational *Landslide Early Warning Systems (LEWSs)*.
DTVT is based on a pair of thresholds used to classify a spatial unit (or *Pixel Aggregation Units (PAUs)*, e.g., a catchment) as stable or not; which are:
##### -	*Failure Probability Threshold (FPT)*: the value of landslide probability value above which a pixel is considered unstable (e.g., â‰¥ 65%);
##### -	*Instability Diffusion Threshold (IDT)*: the amount of unstable pixels required to classify an entire PAU as unstable and to justify issuing a warning in that PAU (e.g., at least 5 pixels or 5% of the total pixels in the unit).
This approach also allows for establishing multiple warning criteria based on the FPT-IDT pair. By integrating DTVT into landslide hazard assessment workflows, decision-makers can effectively leverage LHMs for disaster risk reduction and emergency response.
